Family Library Project:
The point of the Family Library Project is to make a storage system where I simply enter and delete books.
The names of all the books and their authors are inputted into a txt file.
With all the books in the txt file, i should be able to sort the books alphabetically (either by author or title of books).

My problem right now is in the mainframe. 
For example: 
    I can make a button for Add Book, but I cannot actually make that button open up the BookFrame1 (the add book frame). 
    
   If you could please help me with this, I would really appreciate it!!
